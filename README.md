This is the mission statement of https://awesome-appz.github.io

## Who Are We :mortar_board:

We are two developers, honing our skills, by building apps. To find more about us, please check the [team](https://github.com/orgs/awesome-appz/people) section.

## What's The Plan :crystal_ball:

[FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com/map) has a series of projects that we would like to build. 

Yes, there have been [literally hundreds (nay, thousands)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about) of people before us who have achieved this feat. But we want to do it right, with proper finishing touch.

You can find details of our plans below, but let's just say we wanna build apps that people can easily use.

## Detailed Mission Statement :rocket:

FreeCodeCamp has majorly three types of projects

- Front-end projects :sparkles:
- REST API projects :restroom:
- Full-stack projects :earth_asia:

We would approach each of them sincerely, to the best of our abilities. We are not trying to _merely_ get the certificates. Sure, it would be cool, but the bigger agenda is to learn.

For every project, we shall do the following:
- Research the usecase :mag:
- Think what user stories would make it compelling in functionality and UX, compared to its competition. By competition, we mean similar projects in public domain, not necessarily projects made by campers :heart_eyes:
- Think what user stories would make it make it *usable* to an end user :yum:
- After implementing the project, blog about it, share our approach, future works, and learning :facepunch:

Other than this, all projects **MUST** have the following:
- A prototype of the app in Meteor JS, to help us understand Data Schema, complexity etc.
- Front-end deployed via GitHub pages. There would also be links to iOS and Android app on the homepage. If possible, a Desktop app in Electron too.
- GitHub README would have a "Deploy on Heroku" badge (check the end of [this README](https://github.com/wekan/wekan)) so that anyone can deploy an instance on Heroku to verify, if for some reason original deployment is down
- The back-end part of API and full-stack projects has to be deployed on an AWS or Digital Ocean droplet or Google cloud. This means more work than Heroku, but also teaches you how to set up the server, secure it, add SSL, NGINX, Cloudflair, cname etc.
- The back-end should also have Docker images. Yes, it's an overkill; but teaches you how to deploy your app in Docker.
- Unit tests
- Selenium / Phantom JS tests for functional tests
- No Bootstrap. As much as possible, SASS / LESS driven CSS with Flexbox.

Some stuff would be common to all these. For instance, proper login module. Login that supports Facebook, Google, Twitter, and GitHub; as well as Email based login. Also, confirmation email sending and password recovery via email. In fact, we could implement password-less login here, unless it's conflicting with provided user story.

The above means we might have to spend some money. That's ok, as long as we are taking the next step in learning. Investing in your own education is an invaluable investment.
